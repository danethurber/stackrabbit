# StackRabbit

[Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa) inspired(some might say copied) framework for writing RabbitMQ Listeners.

>Expressive ~~HTTP~~ __RabbitMQ__ middleware for node.js to make ~~web applications and APIs~~ __Rabbit Listeners__ more enjoyable to write. ~~Koa's~~ __StackRabbit's__ middleware stack flows in a stack-like manner, allowing you to perform actions downstream then filter and manipulate the response upstream. ~~Koa's~~ __StackRabbit's__ use of generators also greatly increases the readability and robustness of your application.


## Example

Coming soon
